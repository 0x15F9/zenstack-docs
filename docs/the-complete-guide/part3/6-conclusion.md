# Conclusion

In this part of the guide, we've focused on ZenStack's powers for deriving CRUD APIs automatically from the ZModel schema. We had an overview of the different API flavors and learned how to mount the APIs onto a backend framework.

In the next part, we'll see how effortless it is to consume the APIs from a frontend application and eventually turn our Todo project into a full-stack application.

You can find the completed sample project up to the end of this part in the "part3" branch of [the-complete-guide-sample](https://github.com/zenstackhq/the-complete-guide-sample/tree/part3).
