# Omitting Fields

Some database fields can be sensitive and should not be exposed to the client. Password is a good example (even when it's hashed). You can use the `@omit` attribute to mark a field , and it'll be automatically omitted when queried from an enhanced Prisma Client.

```zmodel
model User {
    ...
    password String @password @omit
}
```

:::info

You can use field-level access policy to achieve the same goal:

```zmodel
model User {
    ...
    password String @password @allow('read', false)
}
```

However, using `@omit` is a more appropriate choice since conceptually omitting sensitive field is not a permission issue.
