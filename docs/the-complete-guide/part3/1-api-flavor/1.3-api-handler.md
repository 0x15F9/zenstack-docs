# API Handlers

Although there are many different backend and full-stack frameworks in the Javascript world, the way how APIs are designed is completely independent. So we implemented the API flavors as framework-agnostic API handlers. They take canonical input (HTTP verb, URL, body, etc.) and generate canonical output (status code and body).

The server adapters, as we will see in the next chapter, are responsible to deal with the framework details and handle the transformation between the framework-specific request/response and the canonical format. If in the future we want to introduce a new API flavor, we don't need to change the server adapters.

The following diagram depicts the relationship between the API handlers and the server adapters:

    }}
