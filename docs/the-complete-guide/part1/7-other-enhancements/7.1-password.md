# Hashing Passwords

When using a credential based authentication system, it's important to never store the password in plain text. ZenStack provides a simple way to automatically hash passwords before storing them in the database. To enable it, simply mark the password field with `@password` attribute.

```zmodel
model User {
    id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
    email String @unique
    password String @password
}
```

Under the hood, ZenStack uses [bcryptjs](https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js/tree/master) to generate a hash.

See [here](/docs/reference/zmodel-language#password) for more details about the `@password` attribute.
