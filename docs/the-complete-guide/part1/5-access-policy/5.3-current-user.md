# Accessing Current User


:::info

ZModel compiler resolves the `auth()` function call to a model identified as "auth model". By default, the model named "User" is used, but you can override it using the `@@auth` model-level attribute. Here's an example:

```zmodel
model MyUser {
    ...
    @@auth
}
```

Only fields defined in the auth model are accessible from the `auth()` expression.
