# Post-Update Checks

Among the "create", "read", "update", and "delete" operations, "update" is a special one, because its data has two states: pre-update and post-update. When you write a policy rule for "update", by default you're checking against the pre-update state. But sometimes you may want to inspect the post-update state. For example, you may want to prevent a user setting a "revision" to a smaller value than the current one.

To define a post-update rule, you use the `future()` function to access the post-update state. Here's an example:

```zmodel
model Post {
    ...
    revision Int

    @@allow('update', future().revision > revision)
}
```
