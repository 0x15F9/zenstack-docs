# Omitting Fields

Some database fields can be sensitive and should not be exposed to the client. Password is a good example (even when it's hashed). You can use the `@omit` attribute to mark a field, and it'll be automatically omitted when queried from an enhanced Prisma Client.

```zmodel
model User {
    ...
    password String @password @omit
}
```

:::info

You can use a field-level access policy to achieve the same goal:

```zmodel
model User {
    ...
    password String @password @allow('read', false)
}
```

However, using `@omit` is more appropriate since conceptually omitting sensitive field is not a permission issue.

### üõ†Ô∏è Omitting Password Field From Our Todo App

Let's mark the `password` field with `@omit`:

```zmodel
model User {
    ...
    password String? @password @omit
}
```

Rerun generation, push database schema, and start REPL:

```bash
npx zenstack generate
npx zenstack repl
```

Query users, and you'll find the `password` field is omitted:

```js
.auth { id: 1 }
db.user.findFirst();
```

```js
{
  id: 1,
  createdAt: 2023-11-07T21:37:22.506Z,
  updatedAt: 2023-11-07T21:37:22.506Z,

}
