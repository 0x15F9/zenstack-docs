# Conclusion

In this part of the guide, we've focused on the plugin system of ZenStack. We've learned how to use plugins and how to write one.

ZModel contains a formal representation of how data is organized and its constraints. Besides serving as database schema and access control, it's an excellent single source of truth for generating many other valuable things. Don't hesitate to write your own plugins when you feel the need.

In [Part III](/docs/the-complete-guide/part3/) and [Part IV](/docs/the-complete-guide/part4/) of the guide, you'll see in action how we use plugins to turn our Todo project from a schema to a full-stack application without writing much code.
