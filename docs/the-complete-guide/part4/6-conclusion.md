# Conclusion

In this part of the guide, we've focused on using plugins to generate frontend data query hooks, and use them to build highly responsive data-driven UIs with ease. We've also evolved our sample project into a fully functional application. There are still a few parts unimplemented (like space member management), but since we've covered all essential ZenStack concepts and features with what we've built, we'll skip them in this guide.

You can find the fully completed Todo app built with different stacks in the following repositories:

- [Next.js (pages route) + SWR](https://github.com/zenstackhq/sample-todo-nextjs)
- [Next.js (pages route) + TanStack Query](https://github.com/zenstackhq/sample-todo-nextjs-tanstack)
- [Nuxt + TanStack Query](https://github.com/zenstackhq/sample-todo-nuxt)
- [SvelteKit + TanStack Query](https://github.com/zenstackhq/sample-todo-sveltekit)
